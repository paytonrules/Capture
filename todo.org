#+TITLE: Refactor to get token working

* DONE Move the Token out of the capture node and into a domain object (Provide? OAuth?)
* TODO Merge nodes: Login/OAuth into one
* TODO Move the Token code into its own file
* TODO Move checking for a token out of the oauth node and into the oauth module
* Set the domain object token from our exposed function
- End goal is both the exposed function and the webserver set the token via the same function call
* Make Sure the webserver is using that function call
